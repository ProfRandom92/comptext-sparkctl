# Phase 5C Status Report — Branding Asset Import

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- Created directory [assets/branding/](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/assets/branding/) to host the repository assets.
- Imported and derived the following approved images:
  - `assets/branding/sparkctl-wallpaper.png` directly from the hero image source.
  - `assets/branding/sparkctl-logo.png` by cropping the wide star + wordmark area, trimming the off-white margin, adding padding, and resizing to 1200px wide.
  - `assets/branding/sparkctl-logo-square.png` by cropping the rounded square icon (size 205x205) and resizing it to 1024x1024.
- Wired the primary [README.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/README.md) to reference the wide logo inside a centered paragraph element, removing the pending comment.

## 2. Validation Status
- Verified all image crops are clean and properly placed in `assets/branding/`.
- Rust source code, testing configurations, and cargo settings remain untouched and compiler-stable.

## 3. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
