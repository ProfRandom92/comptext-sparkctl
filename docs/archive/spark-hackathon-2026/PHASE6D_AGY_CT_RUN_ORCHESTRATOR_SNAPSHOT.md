# Phase 6D agy-ct Run Orchestrator Snapshot

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- **Files Changed**:
  - [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs) (Implemented `run_orchestrator` workflow mapping sequentially)
- **Files Created**:
  - [PHASE6D_AGY_CT_RUN_ORCHESTRATOR_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6D_AGY_CT_RUN_ORCHESTRATOR_SNAPSHOT.md) (This snapshot file)

## 2. agy-ct run Orchestrator Execution Flow
The orchestrator sequential layout is defined inside the Rust crate main module:
1. **workspace doctor** -> Calling `sparkctl::doctor::run_doctor()`
2. **context pipeline** -> Calling `sparkctl::context_all::run_context_all()`
3. **spark demo** -> Calling `sparkctl::spark_demo::run_spark_demo()`
4. **handoff check** -> Calling `sparkctl::handoff_check::run_handoff_check()`

Each stage executes in order. If any stage returns an error:
- The orchestrator stops immediately (first-failure abort).
- Output emits the failed stage name and a `result FAIL` flag.
- The binary propagates the failure exit code downstream.

## 3. Preservation of sparkctl
- Legacy integration tests and backward-compatible subcommand execution layers are preserved.
- `sparkctl` code modules have not been modified or refactored.

## 4. Dependency Status
- No changes to dependencies have been made inside [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml). No external crates were introduced.

## 5. Forbidden Scope Confirmed
- No run orchestration checks beyond the 4 approved validation backends were written.
- No network requests, git checkouts, staging, commits, or pushes were executed.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains unstaged and untracked.

## 6. Claim Hygiene Wording Rules
- **Wording Rules Compliance**:
  - Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
  - Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
  - No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- **Forbidden Claims**:
  - Refuses to claim being "fully deterministic", "100% safe", "official SPARK JSON compatibility", or EU AI Act compliance.

## 7. Validation Execution Report
All integration tests, formatting checks, clippy evaluations, compile operations, and E2E command executions run with complete success:
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo check` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo test` -> OK (PASS; 32 tests passed)
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run` -> OK (PASS; prints compact plan, runs stages, outputs PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- doctor` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- validate` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- handoff` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- demo` -> OK (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- context all` -> OK (PASS)
