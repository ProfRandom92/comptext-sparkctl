# Phase 6B agy-ct Binary & Clap Tree Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected
- [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml)
- [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs)
- [PHASE6B_AGY_CT_BINARY_CLAP_TREE_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6B_AGY_CT_BINARY_CLAP_TREE_SNAPSHOT.md)

## 2. Audit Findings
- **Cargo.toml Changes**: Audited `Cargo.toml` and verified modifications are strictly limited to the registration of the `agy-ct` binary target (`[[bin]]` block). No other changes were introduced.
- **Dependency Audit**: Confirmed that no external dependencies or crate upgrades were added.
- **Source Code Audit**: Confirmed `agy_ct.rs` contains only the `clap` parser definition and global flags. It implements help/usage documentation and prints standard placeholder lines on subcommand execution.
- **Pipeline and Orchestrator Logic**: Verified that no package compression, context rendering, schema check, report export, notebook bundling, or automatic run orchestrator logic is present. All operations remain surface-level.
- **sparkctl Compatibility**: Preserved by design; `sparkctl` and its underlying modules are untouched. Legacy tests pass completely.
- **Snapshot File**: Confirmed that the Phase 6B implementation snapshot `PHASE6B_AGY_CT_BINARY_CLAP_TREE_SNAPSHOT.md` exists at the root.
- **POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md**: Remained untracked and unstaged.

## 3. Claim Hygiene Result
All updates comply with safety wording rules:
- No claims of being "fully deterministic" are made.
- No claims of being "100% safe" are made.
- No claims of "no risks" are made.
- No statements claiming "official SPARK compatibility" are present.
- No EU AI Act compliance claims are made.

## 4. Safety Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.

## 5. Known Limitations
- GitHub Actions status is verified through GitHub UI outside this local rollup.
- `handoff-check` is local repository readiness only and does not verify remote CI.
- No official SPARK compatibility claim is made.
- No compliance claim is made.

## 6. Risks
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 7. Next Recommended Phase
- Commit Phase 6B binary initialization and clap command tree changes only after approval.
