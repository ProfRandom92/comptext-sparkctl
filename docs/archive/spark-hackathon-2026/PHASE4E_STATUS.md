# Phase 4E Status Report — sparkctl spark-demo implementation

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- Implemented `sparkctl spark-demo` subcommand in [src/sparkctl/spark_demo.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/spark_demo.rs) and registered it inside [src/sparkctl/mod.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/mod.rs) and [src/bin/sparkctl.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/sparkctl.rs).
- Wrapped standard local Rust checks and existing local commands in order: `compress`, `context-build`, `context-render`, and `context-validate`.
- Added `test_sparkctl_spark_demo_execution` integration test in [tests/spark_roundtrip.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/tests/spark_roundtrip.rs) to verify correct execution of the new subcommand.

## 2. Validation Status
- Crate formatting check: Passed
- Compilation checks: Passed
- Crate tests: Passed (31/31 tests passed successfully)
- Clippy warnings check: Passed

## 3. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
