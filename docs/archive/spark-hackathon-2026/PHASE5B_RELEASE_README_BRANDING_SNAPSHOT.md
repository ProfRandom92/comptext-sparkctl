# Phase 5B Release README & Branding Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected
- [README.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/README.md) (Modified and audited)
- [agy7rust/PHASE5B_STATUS.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/PHASE5B_STATUS.md) (Created and audited)
- [PHASE5A_RELEASE_README_BRANDING_HANDBOOK.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE5A_RELEASE_README_BRANDING_HANDBOOK.md) (Audited planning baseline)

## 2. README Sections Confirmed
The primary repository `README.md` includes the following sections:
- **Title**: `sparkctl`
- **Project Identity**: `Antigravity-CompText v7 / SPARK Context Layer`
- **Purpose**: A concise purpose paragraph detailing deterministic trace compression and operational context validation.
- **Command Surface**:
  - `sparkctl doctor`
  - `sparkctl rust-validate`
  - `sparkctl context-all`
  - `sparkctl spark-demo`
  - `sparkctl handoff-check`
- **Quickstart**: Detailed instructions using `cargo run --bin sparkctl -- <command>` from the `agy7rust` directory.
- **Artifact Outputs**: Mapped output locations for `extraction.spkg`, `context.json`, and `context_render.txt`.
- **Validation**: Step-by-step commands including `cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, and `cargo clippy`.
- **Boundaries & Claims**: Clear statements regarding local/offline limitations, no remote CI checking, no regulatory compliance, and no official SPARK compatibility.
- **Project Phase Status**: Current completion state for Phase 3, Phase 4, and Phase 5.

## 3. Status File Path Confirmation
- **Expected Status File Path**: `agy7rust/PHASE5B_STATUS.md` exists and contains correct metadata.
- **Repository Root Status Check**: No duplicate or misplaced status files were found at the root directory level.

## 4. Branding Asset Status
- **Branding Directory**: `assets/branding/`
- **Branding Assets**: No local logo or wallpaper image assets were present in the source files. No placeholder image files were created, and no remote image URLs were used.
- **Branding Alt-Text & Mapping**: Logo configuration alt text is documented as pending in a comment line near the top of the README.

## 5. Claim Hygiene Result
All documentation elements follow the strict claim hygiene constraints:
- No claims of being "fully deterministic" are made.
- No claims of being "100% safe" are made.
- No claims of "no risks" are made.
- No statements claiming "official SPARK compatibility" are present.
- No EU AI Act compliance claims are made.

## 6. Validation Result
- Audits verified that only documentation and status reports were altered in Phase 5B.
- The Rust application source code, configuration files, and testing framework remain untouched and compiler-stable.

## 7. Safety Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.

## 8. Known Limitations
- GitHub Actions status is verified through GitHub UI outside this local rollup.
- `handoff-check` is local repository readiness only and does not verify remote CI.
- No official SPARK compatibility claim is made.
- No compliance claim is made.

## 9. Risks
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 10. Next Recommended Phase
- Commit Phase 5B release README and branding implementation changes only after approval.
