# Phase 6A agy-ct CLI Architecture Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected
- [PHASE6A_AGY_CT_AGENTIC_DETERMINISTIC_CLI_HANDBOOK.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6A_AGY_CT_AGENTIC_DETERMINISTIC_CLI_HANDBOOK.md)

## 2. Audit Findings
- **Handbook Confirmation**: The handbook `PHASE6A_AGY_CT_AGENTIC_DETERMINISTIC_CLI_HANDBOOK.md` exists and defines the product definition, compatibility strategy, human/AX experience parameters, output modes, command taxonomy, automatic execution workflow steps, caching, output models, and roadmap.
- **Strict Scope Boundaries**:
  - No Rust source files were added or modified.
  - No changes were made to `Cargo.toml` or dependencies.
  - No integration or unit tests were added or modified.
  - No changes were made to the main `README.md` file.
  - No image assets or repository assets were added or modified.
  - No modifications to GitHub workflow files were introduced.
  - No dependency additions were made.
  - No git actions (commits, pushes, pulls, fetches) were performed.
  - No network activity occurred.
- **sparkctl Compatibility**: Preserved by design; `sparkctl` remains the entry point for compatibility integrations, and `agy-ct` is mapped as a separate, parallel CLI.
- **Phase 6A Scope**: Handbook and planning only; no code implementation is approved.
- **Phase 6B Scope**: Set to setup the binary base shell and the nested `clap` command parser tree only.
- **Evaluation Dependencies**: Libraries such as `dag_exec`, `asupersync`, `wasm_sandbox`, `wasmtime`, `tokio`, and `ratatui` are strictly classified as future/evaluate-only options.

## 3. Claim Hygiene Result
Wording guidelines are followed:
- No claims of being "fully deterministic" are made.
- No claims of being "100% safe" are made.
- No claims of "no risks" are made.
- No statements claiming "official SPARK compatibility" are present.
- No EU AI Act compliance claims are made.

## 4. Safety Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.

## 5. Known Limitations
- GitHub Actions status is verified through GitHub UI outside this local rollup.
- `handoff-check` is local repository readiness only and does not verify remote CI.
- No official SPARK compatibility claim is made.
- No compliance claim is made.

## 6. Risks
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 7. Next Recommended Phase
- Commit Phase 6A architecture handbook and audit snapshot only after approval.
