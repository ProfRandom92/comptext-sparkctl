# CI Rust Validation Snapshot Report

## 1. CI Workflow Configuration
- **File Path:** `.github/workflows/rust-validation.yml`
- **Triggers:** Push and pull request to the `main` branch.
- **Environment:** Run on `ubuntu-latest`.
- **Permissions:** `contents: read` to ensure read-only workspace access.

## 2. Command Pipeline
The CI job executes the standard Rust validation suite offline under the `agy7rust` workspace:
1. `cargo fmt --all --check`
2. `cargo check`
3. `cargo test`
4. `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

## 3. Scope and File Audit
- **Files Created:**
  - `.github/workflows/rust-validation.yml`
  - `CI_RUST_VALIDATION_SNAPSHOT.md`
- **Verification Note:** `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` was previously created for manual validation checks and is intentionally excluded from the staging target of this CI phase changes.

## 4. Local Validation and Commit Assertions
- CI is configured to run the Rust validation checklist on GitHub-hosted runners.
- Local project validation remains the source of truth until CI has executed successfully on GitHub.

## 5. Non-Claims
- **CI Safety Guarantee:** CI ensures compilation and lint compliance but does not declare the software to be 100% bug-free or immune to runtime errors.
- **Workflow Scope:** Runs checks only; does not build docker images, deploy code, or execute external webhooks.

## 6. Risks
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
