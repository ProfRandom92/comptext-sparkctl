# Phase 6E JSON Report Export Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected & Audited
- [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml)
- [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs)
- [PHASE6E_JSON_REPORT_EXPORT_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6E_JSON_REPORT_EXPORT_SNAPSHOT.md)

## 2. Audit Findings & Checks

### JSON Output and Structs Audit
- Struct definitions `Report` and `StageReport` in `agy_ct.rs` map exactly to the schema requested by the user.
- Checked deserialization and writing logic inside `write_report()`. Directory creation (`std::fs::create_dir_all`) checks for workspace bounds and writes directly to `reports/latest.json` under the repo root.
- The JSON validation command `python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json` parses the file successfully.

### Command Surface and Compatibility Audit
- Checked that human-readable console printing inside the `agy-ct run` command is preserved.
- Verified that all legacy commands (`sparkctl` binary subcommands) and other compatibility wrappers (`doctor`, `validate`, `handoff`, `demo`, `context all`) continue to work without modification.
- Checked that unit/integration tests (32/32 tests) pass successfully.

### Dependency Audit
- Audited `agy7rust/Cargo.toml` and verified no new dependency additions were made.

### Worktree State Audit
- The only modified file is `agy_ct.rs`.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains untracked and unstaged.

## 3. Claim Hygiene
All assertions follow standard formatting rules:
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- Refuses to claim SPARK official integration, EU AI Act certification, or forensic/judicial certainties.

## 4. Verification Checkups
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> PASS
- `cargo check` -> PASS
- `cargo test` -> PASS
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run` -> PASS
- `python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json` -> PASS
