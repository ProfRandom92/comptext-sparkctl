# Phase 6A.1 agy-ct Agentic CLI Skills Snapshot

## 1. Files Created
- [.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md)
- [.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md)
- [.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md)

## 2. Purpose of Each Skill
- **Skill 07 (agy-ct CLI Surface)**: Establishes rules for the CLI subcommand structure, parser validation, and preservation of the legacy `sparkctl` binary.
- **Skill 08 (Agentic Output Contract)**: Sets the guidelines for stdout/stderr separation, output formatting (JSON, plain, quiet), exit code mapping, and security requirements.
- **Skill 09 (Phase 6 Implementation Gates)**: Structures the roadmap into phases, controls external dependency updates, and outlines safety limits for network and workspace directory traversal.

## 3. Forbidden Scope Confirmation
- Verified that no Rust code implementation has been added.
- Verified `Cargo.toml` remains unchanged, and no new dependencies have been installed.
- Verified that no integration or unit tests were modified.
- Verified `README.md` has not been edited.
- No image or repository assets were added.
- GitHub Actions workflow configurations remain unchanged.
- No network operations or git commits/pushes were run.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains untracked and unstaged.

## 4. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 5. Next Recommended Phase
- Begin Phase 6B (agy-ct binary initialization and clap command tree setup) only after approval.
