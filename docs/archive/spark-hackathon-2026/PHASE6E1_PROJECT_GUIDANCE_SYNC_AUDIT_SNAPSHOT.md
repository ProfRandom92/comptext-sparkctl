# Phase 6E.1 Project Guidance Sync Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected & Audited
- [AGENTS.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/AGENTS.md)
- [.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md)
- [.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md)
- [.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md)
- [PHASE6E1_PROJECT_GUIDANCE_SYNC_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6E1_PROJECT_GUIDANCE_SYNC_SNAPSHOT.md)

## 2. Audit Findings & Checks

### Documentation Content Audit
- `AGENTS.md` and `.agent/skills/` documents describe CLI orchestrator logic and status correctly.
- Confirmed that `reports/latest.json` is clearly documented as local untracked runtime output.
- Legacy `sparkctl` backward compatibility is preserved.
- Safety boundaries (no official SPARK compliance, EU AI Act compliance, or production-readiness claims) are explicitly documented.
- Performance baseline mapping and optional NotebookLM source bundle exporting are designated as future/optional roadmap phases.

### Code & Cargo Audit
- Verified that no Rust code changes or Cargo.toml modifications were introduced in this phase.
- No dependency changes were made.

### Git Worktree Audit
- Only documentation updates (`AGENTS.md`, `.agent/skills/*.md`) are tracked.
- `reports/latest.json` and `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remain unstaged and untracked.

## 3. Claim Hygiene
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- Refuses to claim SPARK official integration, EU AI Act certification, or forensic/judicial certainties.

## 4. Verification Checkups
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> PASS
- `cargo check` -> PASS
- `cargo test` -> PASS
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run` -> PASS
- `python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json` -> PASS
