# Phase 4D Fix Status Report — Schema Argument Support in context-validate

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- Modified [src/commands/mod.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/commands/mod.rs) to add `schema: Option<String>` to `Commands::ContextValidate`.
- Modified [src/main.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/main.rs) to match the new `schema` argument and execute a real, non-faked validation check comparing the context metadata (schema name, required field paths) with the loaded schema file definition if a schema path is provided.
- Updated [src/sparkctl/context_all.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/context_all.rs) to pass `-s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json` to the subcommand execution.

## 2. Validation Status
- Crate formatting check: Passed
- Compilation checks: Passed
- Crate tests: Passed (30/30 tests passed successfully)
- Direct command verification: Running `cargo run --bin agy7rust -- context-validate -i ../artifacts/spark/context.json -s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json` completed with status 0, printing `OK: schema verification passed`.

## 3. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
