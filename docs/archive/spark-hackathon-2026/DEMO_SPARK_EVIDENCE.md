# SPARK Challenge Demo Evidence Bundle

## 1. Project Positioning

CompText-Sparkctl is an offline developer utility designed to support local packaging, rendering, validation, and handoff checking of operational context artifacts. It operates strictly within a local/offline validated scope to support SPARK-adjacent agent workflows.

## 2. Short Demo Narrative

CompText-Sparkctl turns extraction and context artifacts into a local validation and handoff pipeline. It automatically runs diagnostics, compiles and renders mock context models, verifies data constraints, and reports a structured JSON run log.

## 3. What the Demo Proves

- **Offline Stage Sequencing:** Automatically orchestrates workspace verification, packaging, rendering, and handoff checking in sequence.
- **Structured Exporter Log:** Generates a structured JSON log of steps at `reports/latest.json` on successful execution.
- **Metadata Separation:** Extracts deterministic context keys and handles validation without exposing raw payload fields.

## 4. Claim Hygiene (What the Demo Does Not Claim)

- **No Official Assertions:** This project does not assert compatibility with official specifications. It is designed for SPARK-ready context artifacts in adjacent developer setups.
- **No Production Assumptions:** This utility is for demonstration and baseline validation purposes and does not assert production readiness.
- **No Regulation Certifications:** The tool does not certify compliance with regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act. It serves as support for record-keeping patterns.
- **Environment Bounds:** Measurements, constraints, and execution logs are local/offline validated scope only. Execution risks are bound to the local testing environment.

## 5. Artifact Map

The workspace organizes generated and static artifacts across the following paths:

- [artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg](artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg) — Binary SPARK-style compressed package.
- [artifacts/spark/context.json](artifacts/spark/context.json) — JSON operational context layout.
- [artifacts/spark/context_render.txt](artifacts/spark/context_render.txt) — Rendered text overview of the context layers.
- [reports/latest.json](reports/latest.json) — Local orchestrator step run log (untracked).
- [reports/performance_baseline.json](reports/performance_baseline.json) — Recorded local execution baseline timings.

## 6. Expected Reviewer Path

Reviewers are recommended to follow these verification steps:

1. **Inspect README.md:** Read the core design specifications and command mappings in [README.md](README.md).
2. **Execute Orchestrator:** Run the main pipeline orchestrator:
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run
   ```
3. **Inspect Step Report:** View the structured JSON log output:
   ```bash
   python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json
   ```
4. **Inspect Context Layout:** Verify the generated model structure in [context.json](artifacts/spark/context.json).
5. **Inspect Render Output:** Open [context_render.txt](artifacts/spark/context_render.txt) to see the printed text log.
6. **Inspect Performance Baseline:** Read [PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md](PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md) to compare timings.

## 7. Exact Commands for Reviewers

Please navigate to `agy7rust/` directory and execute:

```bash
# Execute local step sequence orchestrator
cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run

# Validate generated orchestrator run report
python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json

# Execute full context lifecycle build, render, validate
cargo run --bin agy-ct -- context all

# Run legacy compatibility doctor diagnostics
cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor
```
