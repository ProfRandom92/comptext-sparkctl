# Phase 6D agy-ct Run Orchestrator Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected & Audited
- [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml)
- [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs)
- [PHASE6D_AGY_CT_RUN_ORCHESTRATOR_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6D_AGY_CT_RUN_ORCHESTRATOR_SNAPSHOT.md)

## 2. Audit Findings & Checks

### Orchestrator Implementation Audit
- The implementation of `run_orchestrator()` inside `agy_ct.rs` maps exactly to the four approved validation backends in sequence.
- All errors returned by backends immediately abort execution and yield non-zero returns via the `Result<()>` return model.
- Formatting check rules on stdout and exit criteria behave as expected.

### Command Tree Validation Audit
- Verified that no unapproved commands were added to the parser.
- Existing wrappers (`doctor`, `validate`, `handoff`, `demo`, `context all`) were not modified and compile safely.
- Legacy `sparkctl` functions function without modifications.

### Dependency Audit
- Audited `agy7rust/Cargo.toml` and verified no dependencies or crate updates have been introduced.

### Git Worktree Audit
- Only the orchestrator modifications inside `agy_ct.rs` are tracked.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains unstaged and untracked.

## 3. Claim Hygiene
All assertions follow standard formatting rules:
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- Refuses to claim SPARK official integration, EU AI Act certification, or forensic/judicial certainties.

## 4. Verification Checkups
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> PASS
- `cargo check` -> PASS
- `cargo test` -> PASS (32 tests)
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor` -> PASS
