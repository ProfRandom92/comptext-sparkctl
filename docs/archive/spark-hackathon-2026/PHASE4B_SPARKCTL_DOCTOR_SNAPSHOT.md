# Phase 4B Snapshot Report — sparkctl doctor audit

## 1. Sandbox Root & Scope
- **Phase Name:** Phase 4B sparkctl doctor audit and snapshot
- **Sandbox Root:** `C:\Users\contr\sandbox_workspace\Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified`

## 2. Files Inspected
The following modified and created files were audited for structural correctness:
- [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml) (Modified to register `sparkctl` binary)
- [agy7rust/src/bin/sparkctl.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/sparkctl.rs) (Created CLI entrypoint)
- [agy7rust/src/sparkctl/mod.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/mod.rs) (Created modules registration mod.rs)
- [agy7rust/src/sparkctl/doctor.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/doctor.rs) (Created diagnostics checks implementation)
- [agy7rust/tests/spark_roundtrip.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/tests/spark_roundtrip.rs) (Modified to append `test_sparkctl_doctor_execution` integration test)
- [agy7rust/PHASE4B_STATUS.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/PHASE4B_STATUS.md) (Created status overview)

## 3. CLI Command Surface
- **Implemented Command:** `sparkctl doctor`
- **Other Phase 4 Commands Status:**
  - `rust-validate` (Not implemented)
  - `spark-demo` (Not implemented)
  - `context-all` (Not implemented)
  - `handoff-check` (Not implemented)

## 4. Safety & Security Boundaries
- **No Git / Remote Actions:** `doctor` does not execute git commands, add remotes, or perform git staging/commits/pushes.
- **No Network Activity:** The diagnostics verify file presence entirely offline.
- **Strict Directory Bounds:** `doctor` checks files only within the workspace directory scope; no parent/sibling directory scans are initiated.
- **No Cargo Subcommands Execution:** `doctor` operates via direct path verification checks rather than spawning cargo commands.

## 5. Leak & Privacy Boundaries
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- The `doctor` command restricts its operations to evaluating file presence. No file read, parse, or print actions of applicant detail strings, decision recommendations, or extraction notes are performed.

## 6. Test Suite Status
- **Current Total Integration Tests:** 28 tests.
- **New Test Cases Added:** `test_sparkctl_doctor_execution` verifies that the `doctor` binary can be compiled and successfully executed via cargo, generating the expected check statuses and exiting with status 0.

## 7. Execution Logs
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> OK (Success)
- `cargo check` -> OK (Success)
- `cargo test` -> OK (28 tests passed successfully)
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> OK (Success)
- `cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor` -> OK (doctor result: PASS)

## 8. Risks
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 9. Recommended Next Phase
- Phase 4C: Implement other subcommands (rust-validate, spark-demo, context-all, and handoff-check).
