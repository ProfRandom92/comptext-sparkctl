# Phase 4D Status Report — sparkctl context-all implementation

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- Implemented `sparkctl context-all` subcommand in [src/sparkctl/context_all.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/context_all.rs) and registered it inside [src/sparkctl/mod.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/sparkctl/mod.rs) and [src/bin/sparkctl.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/sparkctl.rs).
- Added schema-argument (`-s`) support to the main `context-validate` subcommand and updated the execution path to validate context against the provided schema definition.
- Updated `sparkctl context-all` command orchestration to pass `-s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json` to the validation tool.
- Added `test_sparkctl_context_all_execution` integration test in [tests/spark_roundtrip.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/tests/spark_roundtrip.rs) to verify correct execution of the new subcommand.

## 2. Validation Status
- Crate formatting check: Passed
- Compilation checks: Passed
- Crate tests: Passed (30/30 tests passed successfully)
- Clippy warnings check: Passed

## 3. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
