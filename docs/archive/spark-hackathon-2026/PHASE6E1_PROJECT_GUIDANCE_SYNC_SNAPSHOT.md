# Phase 6E.1 Project Guidance Sync Snapshot

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- **Files Changed**:
  - [AGENTS.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/AGENTS.md) (Updated cargo/binary mapping instructions)
  - [.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/07_cli_surface.md) (Added details on Phase 6D/6E orchestrator and report paths)
  - [.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/08_agentic_output_contract.md) (Documented `reports/latest.json` structure and untracked bounds)
  - [.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/.agent/skills/09_phase6_implementation_gate.md) (Marked Phase 6B-6E gates as complete, defined optional/future gates)
- **Files Created**:
  - [PHASE6E1_PROJECT_GUIDANCE_SYNC_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6E1_PROJECT_GUIDANCE_SYNC_SNAPSHOT.md) (This snapshot file)

## 2. Updated Project Guidelines
The guidance changes document:
- The execution of `agy-ct run` (orchestrating workspace doctor, context pipeline, spark demo, and handoff checks).
- The automatic export of `reports/latest.json` on execution.
- The untracked runtime status of `reports/latest.json`.
- The preservation of legacy `sparkctl` backward-compatibility.
- Standard safety guidelines (refusing official SPARK compatibility, EU AI Act compliance, and production readiness).
- Optional future gates (cache valves, NotebookLM source bundles, and performance baseline validations).

## 3. Claim Hygiene
- **Wording Rules Compliance**:
  - Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
  - Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
  - No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- **Forbidden Claims Avoided**:
  - Avoided claims of being "fully deterministic", "100% safe", "no risks", "official SPARK JSON compatibility", or EU AI Act compliance.

## 4. Local Validation Status
- Formatting check (`cargo fmt --all --check`): OK (PASS)
- Compilation check (`cargo check`): OK (PASS)
- Unit and integration tests (`cargo test`): OK (PASS; 32 tests passed)
- Clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`): OK (PASS)
- CLI execution check (`cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run`): OK (PASS; creates report at `reports/latest.json`)
- JSON validation check (`python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json`): OK (PASS)
- Legacy command verification (`cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor`): OK (PASS)
