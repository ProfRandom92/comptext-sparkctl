# Phase 3 GitHub Handoff — SPARK Operational Context Layer

## Status

- **Repository:** `ProfRandom92/Antigravity-Comptextv7`
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Phase 3 commit:** `a7c4784ce5dd72dfc0444e0a94c17649469b251e`
- **Commit message:** `feat(context-layer): add SPARK operational context layer`
- **Handoff status:** pushed and ready for downstream review

## Phase 3 Scope

Phase 3 adds an offline operational context layer for the Rust SPARK path under `agy7rust/`.

Completed slices:

- **Phase 3A — context model:** `OperationalContext`, dependency edges, validation metadata, stable sorting, and model-shape checks.
- **Phase 3B — context-build:** builds `artifacts/spark/context.json` from the packaged SPARK-style extraction and schema anchors.
- **Phase 3C — context-render:** renders `artifacts/spark/context.json` into deterministic, token-light text at `artifacts/spark/context_render.txt`.
- **Phase 3D — context-validate:** validates the operational context structure and configured leak boundaries.

## CLI Surface

Run from `agy7rust/`:

```bash
cargo run -- context-build -i ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg -s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json -o ../artifacts/spark/context.json
cargo run -- context-render -i ../artifacts/spark/context.json -o ../artifacts/spark/context_render.txt
cargo run -- context-validate -i ../artifacts/spark/context.json
```

Related existing commands:

```bash
cargo run -- compress -i ../examples/spark/extraction.json -o ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg
cargo run -- inspect  -i ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg
cargo run -- verify   -i ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg
cargo run -- replay   -i ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg
cargo run -- schema-check -i ../examples/spark/extraction.json -s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json
```

## Validation Recorded Before Handoff

The following validation commands were run successfully in the validated local scope before the Phase 3 push:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo check
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo run -- context-build -i ../artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg -s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json -o ../artifacts/spark/context.json
cargo run -- context-render -i ../artifacts/spark/context.json -o ../artifacts/spark/context_render.txt
cargo run -- context-validate -i ../artifacts/spark/context.json
cargo run -- schema-check -i ../examples/spark/extraction.json -s ../schemas/genehmigung_v1.json
powershell -File ./demo_spark.ps1
```

Observed result:

- `cargo test` passed 27/27 tests in the validated local scope.
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- `target/` and local build caches were excluded from the Git handoff.

## Recommended Next Step

Perform a fresh clone verification from GitHub and rerun the Rust validation checklist from `agy7rust/` before opening a public release note or hackathon submission package.
