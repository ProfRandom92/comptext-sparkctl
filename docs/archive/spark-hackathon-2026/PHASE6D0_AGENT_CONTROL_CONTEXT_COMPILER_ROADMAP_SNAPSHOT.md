# Phase 6D.0 Agent-Control and Context Compiler Roadmap Snapshot

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- **Files Created**:
  - [PHASE6D0_AGENT_CONTROL_CONTEXT_COMPILER_ROADMAP_HANDBOOK.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6D0_AGENT_CONTROL_CONTEXT_COMPILER_ROADMAP_HANDBOOK.md) (The future Agent-Control and Context Compiler roadmap)
  - [PHASE6D0_AGENT_CONTROL_CONTEXT_COMPILER_ROADMAP_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6D0_AGENT_CONTROL_CONTEXT_COMPILER_ROADMAP_SNAPSHOT.md) (This snapshot file)

## 2. Roadmap Summary
- **deterministic context layer**: Established `CompText-Sparkctl` as the validation layer.
- **Context Compiler Concept**: Outlines input flow: Classification -> Scoring -> Deduplication -> Payload Compression -> Prompt Sectioning.
- **Pipeline Model**: Outlines sequential checklist stages (PLAN, CONTEXT, EXECUTE, VERIFY, PATCH_OR_ANSWER).
- **Structured Events & Artifacts**: Establishes run outcomes including event streams (`run_started` through `final_output_created`) and structured run files tracking selected and discarded context.

## 3. Boundaries Enforced
- No multi-agent scheduler.
- No worktree orchestration.
- No GUI runtime or web frontend.
- No external Python Pydantic AI framework integrations.
- No subagent execution runs.
- NotebookLM source bundle remains optional and unimplemented.

## 4. Claim Hygiene & Wording Rules
- **Wording Rules Compliance**:
  - Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
  - Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
  - No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- **Forbidden Claims Avoided**:
  - No claims of being "fully deterministic", "100% safe", or having "no risks".
  - No claims of official SPARK JSON compatibility or EU AI Act compliance.

## 5. Local Validation Status
- Formatting check (`cargo fmt --all --check`): OK (PASS)
- Compilation check (`cargo check`): OK (PASS)
- Unit and integration tests (`cargo test`): OK (PASS; 32 tests passed)
- Clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`): OK (PASS)
- CLI execution check (`cargo run --bin agy-ct -- --help`): OK (PASS)
- Legacy execution check (`cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor`): OK (PASS)

## 6. Next Steps
- Perform Phase 6D.0 audit before commit.
