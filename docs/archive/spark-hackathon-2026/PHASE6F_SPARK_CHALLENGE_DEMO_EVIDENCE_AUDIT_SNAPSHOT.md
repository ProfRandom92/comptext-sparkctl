# Phase 6F SPARK Challenge Demo Evidence Audit Snapshot

## 1. Files Inspected & Audited
- [DEMO_SPARK_EVIDENCE.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/DEMO_SPARK_EVIDENCE.md)
- [PHASE6F_SPARK_CHALLENGE_DEMO_EVIDENCE_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6F_SPARK_CHALLENGE_DEMO_EVIDENCE_SNAPSHOT.md)

## 2. Audit Findings & Checks

### Reviewer Step Audit
- Checked that all reviewer commands (`cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run`, `python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json`, `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- context all`, and `cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor`) exist, compile correctly, run without error flags, and terminate with exit status 0.
- Verified that the expected path for reviewers clearly points to checking [README.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/README.md), running the orchestrator, and examining the resulting `reports/latest.json` and artifact output files.

### Artifact Mapping Audit
- Verified that all mapped files (`extraction.spkg`, `context.json`, `context_render.txt`, `latest.json`, `performance_baseline.json`) match the paths and hashes recorded in Phase 6G.

### JSON Exporter Validity Check
- Verified that `reports/latest.json` is successfully parsed by `python -m json.tool` and complies with formatting requirements.

## 3. Claim Hygiene
All assertions follow standard formatting rules:
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- **Required Scoped Phrasing:**
  - Operations are limited to the local/offline validated scope.
  - Generates SPARK-ready context artifacts.
  - Designed for SPARK-adjacent agent workflows.
- **Forbidden Claims Avoided:**
  - Strictly avoided all prohibited claims (official compatibility statements, production readiness assertions, regulatory compliance certificates, full determinism claims, 100% safety assurances, and no-risk claims).

## 4. Verification Checkups
- `cargo fmt --all --check` -> PASS
- `cargo check` -> PASS
- `cargo test` -> PASS
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run` -> PASS
- `python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- context all` -> PASS
- `cargo run --bin sparkctl -- doctor` -> PASS
