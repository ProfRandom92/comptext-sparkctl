# Phase 6B agy-ct Binary & Clap Tree Snapshot

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- **Files Created**:
  - [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs) (The new CLI entrypoint binary introducing the complete nested subcommand structure)
- **Files Changed**:
  - [agy7rust/Cargo.toml](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/Cargo.toml) (Registered the target binary `agy-ct`)

## 2. Dependency Status
- No new external packages or dependencies were added to `Cargo.toml`.
- The binary builds using existing dependencies (`clap`, `anyhow`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `sha2`, `hex`).

## 3. CLI Command Tree Surface
`agy-ct` exposes the exact command structure defined in Phase 6A:
- `run`: Automatically coordinate the full local step sequence.
- `demo`: Run a predefined end-to-end trace workflow.
- `doctor`: Diagnose local project readiness.
- `validate`: Validate current project formatting, tests, and clippy rules.
- `handoff`: Verify local repository handoff readiness.
- `package`: Package commands.
  - `compress`: Compress raw extraction files to `.spkg`.
  - `inspect`: Read sidecar properties and headers from `.spkg`.
  - `verify`: Run SHA-256 cryptographic verification of `.spkg`.
  - `replay`: Reconstruct and replay sidecar trace.
  - `adversarial`: Verify robustness against tampered payload attributes.
- `context`: Context commands.
  - `build`: Generate structured operational context from a package.
  - `render`: Render operational context into token-light text.
  - `validate`: Run structural validation and leak checks on a context.
  - `all`: Execute context build, render, and validate tasks in sequence.
- `schema`: Schema commands.
  - `check`: Validate raw trace files against target JSON schemas.
- `report`: Report commands.
  - `export`: Exporter for generated pipeline JSON reports.
- `notebook`: Notebook commands.
  - `bundle`: Bundles context state and text renderings into a unified documentation payload.

## 4. Global Flags
The following global options are registered in the clap parser:
- `--plain`: Plain text output without animations/progress indicators.
- `--json`: Structured JSON output on stdout.
- `--output <FORMAT>`: Output format (e.g. json).
- `-v, --verbose`: Verbose step-by-step diagnostic statements.
- `-q, --quiet`: Quiet mode: suppress non-error output.
- `--no-color`: Disable ANSI color escapes.
- `--non-interactive`: Disable interactive prompts and abort immediately if input required.
- `--explain <ERROR_CODE>`: Explain a specific error code.

## 5. Help / Usage Verification Checks
Help and usage instructions are verified by running:
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- package --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- context --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- schema --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- report --help` -> (PASS)
- `cargo run --bin agy-ct -- notebook --help` -> (PASS)

## 6. sparkctl Compatibility
- Legacy integration tests and `sparkctl doctor` run successfully without modification.
- Binary separation preserves the functionality of `sparkctl` and ensures backward compatibility.

## 7. Forbidden Scope Confirmed
- Confirmed that no actual pipeline validation logic or run orchestrators were implemented.
- No changes to `README.md`, assets, or workflows have been introduced.
- No remote network fetches, pull operations, or git commits/pushes were conducted.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains untracked and unstaged.

## 8. Validation Status
- Formatting check (`cargo fmt --all --check`): Passed
- Compilation checks (`cargo check`): Passed
- Test execution (`cargo test`): Passed (32/32 tests passed successfully)
- Clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`): Passed

## 9. Safety & Leak Boundaries
- Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
- Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
- No blocking risks found in the validated scope.

## 10. Next Recommended Phase
- Commit Phase 6B binary initialization and clap command tree only after approval.
