# Phase 6E JSON Report Export Snapshot

## 1. Scope Accomplished
- **Files Changed**:
  - [agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/agy7rust/src/bin/agy_ct.rs) (Added `serde` JSON reporting, structs, serialization, and updated `run_orchestrator`)
- **Files Created**:
  - [PHASE6E_JSON_REPORT_EXPORT_SNAPSHOT.md](file:///C:/Users/contr/sandbox_workspace/Antigravity-Comptextv7-unified/git_post_push_verification/repo/PHASE6E_JSON_REPORT_EXPORT_SNAPSHOT.md) (This snapshot file)

## 2. JSON Report Schema & Behavior
Running `agy-ct run` executes the sequential local validations, prints the human-readable plan and output steps, and generates/overwrites the structured report file at `reports/latest.json`.

### Minimum JSON Schema Shape:
```json
{
  "tool": "agy-ct",
  "project": "CompText-Sparkctl",
  "phase": "6E",
  "result": "PASS",
  "stages": [
    {"index": 1, "name": "workspace doctor", "status": "PASS"},
    {"index": 2, "name": "context pipeline", "status": "PASS"},
    {"index": 3, "name": "spark demo", "status": "PASS"},
    {"index": 4, "name": "handoff check", "status": "PASS"}
  ],
  "artifacts": [
    "artifacts/spark/extraction.spkg",
    "artifacts/spark/context.json",
    "artifacts/spark/context_render.txt"
  ],
  "report": "reports/latest.json"
}
```

## 3. Dependency Integrity
- Existing dependency block in `Cargo.toml` (`serde` and `serde_json`) was used.
- No new external crates or libraries have been added.

## 4. Forbidden Scope Confirmed
- No new command taxonomies or flags were added.
- No network connections or remote git commits/pushes were conducted in this execution phase.
- `POST_PUSH_GITHUB_VERIFICATION.md` remains untracked and unstaged.

## 5. Wording Rules & Claim Hygiene
- **Wording Rules Compliance**:
  - Offline behavior was deterministic in the validated test scope.
  - Configured leak checks passed in the validated scope.
  - No blocking risks found in the validated scope.
- **Forbidden Claims Avoided**:
  - No claims of being "fully deterministic", "100% safe", or "no risks" are present.
  - Refuses to claim official SPARK JSON compatibility or EU AI Act compliance.

## 6. Verification Status
- Code formatting check (`cargo fmt --all --check`): OK (PASS)
- Compilation verification (`cargo check`): OK (PASS)
- Unit and integration tests (`cargo test`): OK (PASS; 32 tests)
- Clippy warnings (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`): OK (PASS)
- Local E2E execution (`cargo run --bin agy-ct -- run`): OK (PASS; report created at `reports/latest.json`)
- JSON validation check (`python -m json.tool ../reports/latest.json`): OK (PASS)
